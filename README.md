I am a self taught programmer, and now I know I have to get used to version controll systems like this one. I hear it is so stunning !!
<br>I didn't try them before cse I was already driven into [learning how to code](https://esgrprwanda.rf.gd/CHM_Songs), and thus did not have some time to start working together with senior developers on a scpecific project, which would lead me to using ver-- controll systems.
<br>I wish my self the best of luck into this new journey.

  1. Repository creation includes the following
     * Create a repo,
     * Specify a type of the repo *(Public or Private)*,
     * Add a readme.md file, and more optional things,
     * Save changes / Commit changes to create the repo.
  2. Branch creation and workings
     * Create and name a branch from the **Code** tab in a chosen repo,
     * Make changes to the branch
     * Save changes
       - Create a pull request,
       - Make sure of to select the correct comparison brances *(main branch vs new branch)*,
       - Merge the branches/Commit changes *(Make complete change to the main branch)* #004572, and delete the new branch created for edits.
  3. Text fromatting in different Github files like the one I used in the readme.
