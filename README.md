I am a self taught programmer, and now I know I have to get used to version controll systems like this one. I hear it is so stunning !!
  I didn't try them before cse I was already driven into [learning how to code](https://esgrprwanda.rf.gd/CHM_Songs), and thus did not have some time to start working together with senior developers on a scpecific project, which would lead me to using ver-- controll systems.
  I wish my self the best of luck into this new journey.
